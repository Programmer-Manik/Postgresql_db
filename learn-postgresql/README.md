## Introduction

**PostgreSQL**, often referred to as **Postgres**, has been in active development since 1989 and has evolved into one of the most robust relational database management systems available today. Known for its **ACID compliance** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), it ensures the reliability and integrity of your data. Its advanced features like **multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)**, **triggers**, **foreign keys**, and **stored procedures** make PostgreSQL a top choice for a wide range of applications, from small web apps to large enterprise systems.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this guide will walk you through the essentials of PostgreSQL, from installation to advanced database management techniques.

## Key Features

PostgreSQL offers numerous features that make it stand out as a leading database management system:

- **ACID Compliance**: Guarantees data reliability and consistency in all transactions.
- **JSON Support**: Offers robust support for handling JSON data, allowing for hybrid relational/NoSQL models.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed, handling complex queries efficiently, even under heavy load.
- **Security**: Provides secure authentication methods, encryption, and access control for data protection.
- **Open Source**: Free to use, modify, and distribute under the PostgreSQL license.
- **Replication & Clustering**: Supports replication for high availability and horizontal scaling.

## Getting Started

To get started with PostgreSQL, follow the [installation guide](psql/installation.md) and dive into the core topics:

- [Data Types](psql/data-types.md): Learn about the variety of data types supported by PostgreSQL.
- [Database Operations](psql/database.md): Understand how to perform essential operations such as creating databases and managing users.
- [Tables & Schemas](psql/table-schema.md): Explore how to structure your data using tables and schemas.
- [Querying Data](psql/query.md): Master SQL querying with `SELECT`, `JOIN`, and more.
- [SQL Clauses](psql/clauses.md): Learn how to refine your queries with clauses like `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING`.
- [Advanced Concepts](psql/advance.md): Delve into more complex topics like indexing, stored procedures, and performance tuning.
